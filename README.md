# Instruction for SR Image Reconstruction applied on dermatoscopy skin images

## Prerequisites
You will need to install the following packages before you can use the code:

OpenCV
NumPy
Scikit-Image
Albumentations

It is suggested to create a new conda environment (e.g., dermaSR) and install these packages using conda (or pip).

## dermasr:
The folder describes how to use the Artifacts class and its methods for performing some image processing algorithms on skin images:\
    **artifacts**: contains code to perform some image processing to handle some skin typical image artifacts.\
    **augmentation**: contains code to generate augmented images.\
    **paired**: contains code to generate either low resolution images by involving a degradation pipeline or high resolution images involving enhanchment pipeline.\
