PIPELINE:
#----------1 PHASE: Dataset Preparation
1) Select images with resolution (heightxwidth) >= 1024
2) Solve Darkcorner artifact and Rectangle images "artifact".   
	NB: 1) + 2) integrated into one process.
3) Clone Original Dataset (dataset_noArtifact_or) and Select images manually, deleting those with excessive artifacts: ----> dataset_noArtifact
    - with this script create a JSON file with filename of selected images per each labels and also deleted ones.
4) Do Data Augmentation.
5) Create Dataset Paired.  
	NB: 4) + 5) integrated into one process.

At the end we should have:
- dataset_lowResolution_x8 (2nd order degradation with x8 Downsampling) 
- dataset_lowResolution_x4 (2nd order degradation with x4 Downsampling) 
- dataset_highResolution (Normal image)
- dataset_highResolution+ (Sharpen+median image)

#----------2 PHASE: Training
1) Train a pix2pixHD (and Real-ESRGAN) using paired dataset:
- lowResx8 - highRes -----> Modelx8
- lowResx4 - highRes -----> Modelx4
- lowResx8 - highRes+ -----> Modelx8+
- lowResx4 - highRes+ -----> Modelx4+

#----------3 PHASE: Evaluation
1) Evaluate quality of images from Test Set (this set is obtained from deleted images in phase one)
- Fed lowQuality images to the 4 trained models: -----> obtain the SR ones for each model.
- Use PSNR, SSIM, FSIM to compare quality of lowQuality_imgs and SR_imgs for each model
- Compare results of the 4 models.

Further Work:
2) MOS: Mean Opinion Score
3) Train 2 Classification Models: 
- first using only HR images, then HR+SR (or only SR) images.
- evaluate with DICE, CM and other metrics results obtained.
